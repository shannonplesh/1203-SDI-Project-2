<p>This scenario takes us through the steps needed to buy a property in Miami Beach. The ultimate goal is to buy a hot property. I picked this theme because I like the atmosphere of Miami and I think itâ€™s a nice backdrop for my story.</p>
<p>Serene will gather a list of properties to view and go through them to see if she can find a hot property that she can afford. Once she finds a property she will need to get approved for a loan to buy it. If she is approved she will have enough money to buy the property.</p>
